### Code Kata 19: Word Chains

Javascript solution to Code Kata from Wednesday 14th August, 2013.

Reads the contents of the words file (copy of OS X Lion's /usr/share/dict/words)
and computes the shortest chain from "cat" to "dog". To change the start and end
words edit the function call at the end of the file.

This is essentially an A* search of the words file. Read the comments in the file
for more details!
